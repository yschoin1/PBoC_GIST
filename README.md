PBoC@GIST 2016

Small project during Physical Biology of the Cell(PBoC) at Gwangju Institute Science and Technology(GIST).

In this project, I analyzed 2 freely diffusing bacteria and 1 bacteria that is being chased by a neutrophil.
The first bacteria movie was obtained at GIST by diluting E. coli in growth media.
The second and third bacteria were taken from David Rogers (Vanderbilt Univ.) 1950 neutrophil chase movie.

Coded by Yongseok Choi at GIST and advised by Griffin Chure at Caltech.
